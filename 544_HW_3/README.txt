To run the program, please include the train, test, and dev files 
without extensions in a folder called data, located in the root folder with the .py program.
You can cd to the directory which contains the program in the command prompt,
then run _544_HW_3.py or the file name. This is assuming python is installed on the machine
and is present in the PATH variables.

This can also be run in Visual studio using the sln file or the .py file can be run using whichever
program is convenient, as long as the data folder with the train, dev, and test files is present 
in the root folder with the .py file.

Please note that if running the code in the command prompt there may be warnings which 
will cause the command prompt to close early when the program is first run, but will run to completion
if ran again.
